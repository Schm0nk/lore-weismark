Magran is the Aedyran name for a goddess of war and fire. Magran’s priests commonly
employ firearms, and rumors among Eothasian clergy support that they even helped construct the Godhammer bomb used to destroy Saint Waidwen. Following the Saint’s War, Magran became the most popular deity in Dyrwood. In Aedyr, her symbol is a flame, but in Dyrwood, it is a flaming bomb. Worship of Magran is extensively persecuted in Readceras.
Magran’s faithful are rank-and-file soldiers as well as officers, tacticians, and strategists.
Devices used in warfare, especially those made in the forge, such as weapons and armor, are
also part of Magran’s domain, and Abydon is often an important ally for her. Her priests view
battle and warfare as inevitable human activities that should be pursued with single-minded
efficiency. Consequently, she is not a goddess of battle lust or celebration as much as military
excellence and passionate discipline.
More philosophically, priests of Magran view warfare as the apotheosis of mortal struggle—
not something that should be undertaken at all times, but when undertaken, an endeavor that elevates mortals into a state of divine awareness. Lesser forms of adversity (physical or
otherwise) are also celebrated by the church of Magran as trials that transform (for the better) mortal and spiritual lives.
