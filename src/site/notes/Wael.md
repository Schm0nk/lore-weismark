Wael’s objectives and thought processes are often inscrutable to others—mortal and immortal. It represents both the acts of concealment and obfuscation as well as the acts of revelation and decryption. People pray to it both to protect and hide their secrets as well as to help them unravel a riddle or problem in front of them.
The Obscured is the only consistent manifestation of Wael, though it has supposedly taken thousands of forms among mortals when it suits it to do so. The Obscured appears as a person of constantly shifting sex, age, race, size, and ethnicity, speaking in an endless number of known and unknown (possibly nonsensical) languages. Two things are constant about the appearance of the Obscured: its face has no eyes and it is surrounded by a swirling “cloud” of eyes of all different sizes and shapes, many seemingly painted or illustrated, others monstrous or tiny, but of incredible number and variety.
Wael’s priests are often the founders and caretakers of many centers of learning, including various libraries. The priests’ relationship with knowledge is complicated, for they hide as much as they make available to others. There is even an inner sect of elite priests known as the Hand Occult, authors and scribes writing under pseudonyms who attempt to control the flow of esoteric knowledge. Some academics believe there is a more sinister side to the Hand Occult, but most scholars find the strange scribes’ activities more bizarre and silly than malicious.
