• **Aliases**: “The Quiet Slave,” “The Queen’s Slave,”
“The Schemer,” “The Effigy”
• **Portfolio**: Defiance, secret hatred, covert plots,
resentment, envy, violent rebellion
• **Allies**: Woedica (possibly)
• **Foes**: Abydon
• **Symbol**: The Quiet Slave has no official clergy or temples, and his worship is conducted in secret. His symbol is usually a small human effigy crafted from simple materials like sticks or clay, but always with shards of flint or another black stone for eyes. In other cases, his symbol may be a partially decayed animal (or small human/humanoid) corpse with
the eyes replaced by black stones.

Skaen is usually depicted as a small, bald man whose body is completely covered in scars
from a lash, and whose ears and nose have been cut off. He appears outwardly humble
and submissive, with downcast eyes. A closer look reveals that his eyes are glittering and
black, seething with a quiet hatred, and that one of his fists is clenched.
Those who plot the destruction of their superiors while keeping an impassive face will
whisper a prayer to the Quiet Slave. Political rebels also call upon him for justice, in the
hope that he will intercede on their behalf with Woedica, with whom he is associated.
However, Skaen is an unforgiving deity. If a supplicant tips his hand or acts too rashly,
the god will abandon them. The same goes for those who actually achieve their ambitions and rise to a higher station—they can no longer count on Skaen for aid.
Illustrations of Woedica often include the Quiet Slave. He accompanies her along the
road, walking a few steps behind, carrying her burdens. It isn’t clear if the two deities are true
allies or if Skaen is merely following Woedica because she has lost her seat of power and
plots the downfall of the other gods. Some theologians believe that Woedica stole the
portfolio of vengeance from the Quiet Slave, and he follows her until he can find a way to
take it back. 
Skaen manifests as the Effigy, a horrific creature that is called into being by those who
are truly oppressed and willing to commit unspeakable acts to set themselves free.
Worshipers must choose one of their number to serve as the Effigy, shaving this person’s hair and removing all signs and symbols of gender or identity. The person is then scourged bloody over every inch of their body, their ears and nose cut off, their eyes gouged out and replaced with shiny black stones. Finally, they are made to drink the “privileged blood” of a person of wealth or high birth. This blood must be fresh, and the Effigy must consume every drop. Then, if the offering is accepted by the god (which it often is not), Skaen will manifest in the Effigy, becoming an utterly unstoppable and pitiless vessel of the god’s power, immune to pain and imbued with monstrous strength. As soon as the target oppressors are slain (usually in a gruesome manner), the Effigy falls dead. True appearances of the Effigy are rare. In the most recent case, about a century before the present day, an Effigy reportedly led a backwoods peasant rebellion during which an entire noble family was captured, flayed alive, and nailed to the roof of its estate to be devoured by birds
and flies. 
Understandably, the Slave’s worship is forbidden in some nations—particularly
those with large populations of impoverished peasants or serfs. In the Vailian Republics,
he appears as the Docile Slave—a highly sanitized depiction that is despised (and
frequently defaced) by the lower classes.
In Dyrwood, Skaen’s faithful often double as torturers and executioners, specializing in
the interrogation of high-status prisoners and delighting in their downfall. There are a great
many psychotics in their ranks, whose “eccentricities” are tolerated—even encouraged—as
long as they follow orders and do their jobs. That Skaen is worshiped at all is considered one of the more disturbing characteristics of Dyrwoodan culture, but the basis for it
is well grounded in history. A loose-knit community of Glanfathan practitioners grew
in power after the Broken Stone War made slaves of their warriors. The small following broadened in scope as a reaction to the War of Defiance. Several Effigies were secretly
attempted in hopes of ending the conflictwith the Aedyran Empire. As Skaen is asso-
ciated more closely with domestic transgressions as opposed to national uprisings, he
is not known to openly take sides in formal warfare. This, coupled with his cruel and
malicious nature, has prevented the Skaenite faith from taking a more general hold on
the Dyrwoodan populace, despite the country’s strong love of defiance. The possibility
of Skaen one day choosing a side in a major conflict is not beyond reason, but the conse-
quences of the Quiet Slave antagonizing an entire nation are too grim to imagine.
