Much like Ondra and Berath, Rymrgand seems to be a more ancient, primal sort of deity. Depictions of it—or a god very much like it— appear in some of the oldest Glanfathan ruins and therefore predate present-day civilization. The Beast of Winter takes the form of a massive, shaggy aurochs, its albino fur thickly encrusted with frost and snow. Reports of the creature’s height vary, though it is commonly said to be over thirty feet tall, and sometimes much taller. Despite its size, it is often described as an emaciated creature, as thoughit hasn’t eaten in days or weeks.
All the reported sightings agree that Rymrgand maintains a constant pace, never pausing or faltering. Its appearance is often heralded by a deep, droning call that echoes for miles around. Wherever the Beast steps, all life dies. No form of life is immune to Rymrgand's power, and even the gods are said to flee its passage. Rymrgand is also accompanied by a bitter cold that grows worse as it draws near, and the god itself is often obscured by driving snow and ice.
Witnesses—those lucky enough to get close to Rymrgand and survive—also report seeing figures hiding amid the thick fur of its undersde. These are believed to be the souls of those who ventured too near to the Beast. Their mortal bodies were frozen and are long since gone, but their souls cling to the god’s bushy coat, desperately seeking shelter from the cold. The dwarves of the boreal South have stories of heroes who tried to save the souls of their loved ones from this fate, though such stories typically have tragic ends. Some believe that Rymrgand follows a migratory path from south to north, bringing winter cold from the polar region as it makes its way north, and then allowing the warmth of spring to return when it heads south once more. The discovery of a similar polar region in the far North—as well as reports of the Beast of Winter among peoples there—has cast doubt upon these ancient superstitions... though it is possible that Rymrgand has multiple manifestations.
Sightings and visions of the Beast are thought to be portents of bad luck or impending doom, often appearing in the dreams of leaders before disaster strikes their people. The aurochs’s skull is a near-universal symbol of doom. Berath and Rymrgand share a complicated relationship within the divine pantheon. Though both figures lord over death, Berath is viewed as having dominion over death’s cycle, while Rymrgand is the master of entropy. Some theologians believe Rymrgand would prefer the cycle dismantled, the souls who take part in it disintegrated. This opposi- tional standpoint is reflected in Rymrgand’s worshipers, who view their resurrections as punishments instead of blessings.
