According to ancient tradition, Abydon was once a god like most of the others, capable of taking human form. Then he was slain— by one of the other gods, according to some stories—though the reason has been forgotten with time. For some period afterward, Abydon was thought to have been destroyed. His immortal essence lingered, eventually taking shape and fashioning a new, artificial body for itself, piece by piece. Finally, Abydon returned to “life,” somewhat diminished in power. With Magran’s help, he claimed a new portfolio, becoming patron of industry, machines, and skilled labor. Centuries later, Abydon remains loyal to Magran, forging weapons for her campaigns and often appearing at her side in depictions of the war goddess.
Though he is associated with industry and progress, Abydon is never viewed as a source of inspiration or invention, which are the domain of Hylea. Instead, he is seen as the unfailing hand that enacts the designs of others, like his patron, Magran, and he is identified with the great masses of craftsmen and skilled tradesmen whose labor raises cities and shapes metals and gemstones from the depths of the earth.
To many in the working classes, Abydon is a comforting god, demanding nothing of his followers beyond a hard day’s work and forth- right service to their employers, customers, and lords. He is also an aspirational deity, repre- senting hope for a better future by honest labor instead of plots or machinations. He encourages his followers to remake themselves by learning new skills and trades, just as he “remade” himself in his new artificial form.
All of his clergy are expected to master a practical skill such as smithing or carpentry, and to teach that skill to those who are eager to learn. As such, Abydon has become quite popular, despite his unusual form.
In the intrigues of the gods, Abydon takes little part, though he serves Magran loyally and always takes her side against her enemies. Skaen hates Abydon, who represents exactly the sort of passive surrender to authority that the Quiet Slave despises.
