Ondra is a melancholy and mournful goddess who, legends say, was once in love with the moon. She is the ruler of all seas and oceans, and is venerated by sailors, fishermen, those who live near the shore, and those who mourn loss—especially lost love.
Legends of Ondra are old compared to many legends of other gods. Stories of her romance with the moons can be found in several cultures around the world. In these stories, Ondra falls in love with the moon, but is ignored. She pursues the moon and attempts to touch it, causing part of it to fall into her, losing its glow as it descends into her depths. The event causes horrible catastrophes all over the world. Despite this, legends say Ondra still continues to pursue her love. People believe that the tides are her perpetual pursuit of the remaining moon. Tidal waves, tsunamis, and similar catastrophes are the results of her more aggressive attempts.
In legends, Ondra is one of the few deities that do not take a physical form. In rare cases where she exerts her influence, it is felt through the water or its inhabitants. She is also never known to speak. She is popularly imagined as a goddess who listens and accepts without judgment or reply. As such, many use her (via the ocean or the sea) as a confessional for feelings they cannot otherwise express. People also drop objects into the ocean or sea (including bodies—others’ or their own) to forget about them, believing that Ondra will hold them in the darkness with her piece of the moon.
Ondra’s Giftbearers are groups of men and women who collect donations of trinkets, love notes, and other objects from people who live far inland in exchange for a small fee. The Giftbearers take these objects to the ocean or sea and ceremonially drop them in a particularly deep spot. There have been historical cases of Giftbearers (or people posing as them) abusing their responsibility, either by pawning the gifts they are given or by reading the contents of notes and diaries people give them and using them for black- mailing purposes. As a result, in some areas, Giftbearers are mistrusted or even attacked by suspicious locals. Ondra’s Hair are long, slowly shifting pillars of water that rise up from the surface of oceans and seas. They are the most direct physical manifestation of Ondra anyone has ever recorded, capable of gesturing, manipulating objects in the environment, and even attacking with blinding speed and terrible power. Legends state that Ondra’s Hair manifests to thwart or punish plunderers of the deep sea.
