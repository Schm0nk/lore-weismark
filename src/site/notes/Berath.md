Called Berath in Aedyran and Cirono in Vailian,it is the god of cycles, of doors, and of life and death itself. People commonly place or carve the figure of Berath in doorways, windows, and other “portals” from one place to another,figurative or literal. People commonly refer to Berath using neutral pronouns like “it,” though specific manifestations (e.g., the Pallid Knight, who appears female) are often gendered. In Eir Glanfath’s ruins, explorers have discovered two common figures, Bewnen i Ankew and Ankew i Bewnen (“Life in Death”
and “Death in Life,” respectively), semiskeletal female and male figures who occupy posi-
tions opposite each other in doorways— like a twinned display of the split aspects of
Berath/Cirono.
Berath has a relatively small priesthood, in part because it does not speak often to its
members. However, Berath has many, many petitioners and occasional followers.
The Pallid Knight is a manifestation of Berath that has appeared in legends for at least
three centuries. In these legends, someone escapes or otherwise cheats death and encoun-
ters (or is pursued by) a gaunt female knight in black armor with black hair and eyes and“milk-pale” skin. The knight demands an impossible-to-pay toll for traveling on her lord’s road for too long. The implication is always that the person has overstayed their welcome in
the mortal world and it is time for them to move on. Sometimes the person surrenders to
the knight, sometimes they attack the knight and wind up killing themselves in the process,
and sometimes they flee from the knight and stumble into the Usher.
The Usher is a very old manifestation of Berath. In stories, he often appears much more
obviously supernatural than the Pallid Knight, with skeletal features or simply as a walking
skeleton. The Usher is typically human, but occasionally appears as a dwarf. Unlike the
Pallid Knight, the Usher never speaks, but simply creates a circumstance for the unwit-
ting and unwilling to march to their doom (sometimes directly into their own grave).
Sometimes these manifestations appear alone, but often they are paired, with the Pallid
Knight “blocking” the way and the Usher opening the door to the afterlife. The Pallid
Knight is a more martial and confrontational figure (in part because she also speaks), while
the Usher is more subdued, inviting, and occasionally deceptive.
