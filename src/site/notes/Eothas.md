The Aedyran name for the god of light and redemption, Eothas is often represented as
a young man holding a candle and wearing a crown of shining silver or as his messengers,
the Dawnstars. Influence over the sun and stars contributes to his overall air of grandeur
and importance, putting Eothas at odds with the rest of the pantheon. By divine command,
his churches are strictly regulated in their laws of the faith. A candle, lantern, or torch must
burn in the center of every room, banishing “shadows of unfaithful” to vacant door-
ways (Berath’s realm). Doves are traditionally housed in towering rookeries, and crows
hunted for miles around.
While worship of Eothas is still popular in the Aedyran Empire and Readceras, the
faith is outlawed or at least actively hated by the populace in most cities of Dyrwood
due to events of the Saint’s War that culminated at Halgot Citadel. Though Eothas once
communicated regularly with his faithful, he has not done so since the destruction of Saint
Waidwen at the Battle of Godhammer fifteenyears ago.
Saint Waidwen (a.k.a. Divine King Waidwen or the Martyr King) was a vorlas
(purple-dye-producing plant) farmer living in a remote part of the colony of Readceras.
According to legends, one night, spiritual manifestations of Eothas, the Dawnstars,
appeared to the young farmer and told him to punish the Aedyran governor for leading the
people to ruin. Waidwen went to his village and told people what he had seen and heard.
Initially ignored and later attacked for his beliefs, Waidwen began manifesting miracu-
lous powers. This drew devoted believers from all over his county and eventually fomented a
popular revolt.
Waidwen, assisted by some knights and nobles who believed in his cause, eventually
marched on the capital city and confronted the imperial governor. The governor was not
killed, but was forced to abdicate power and leave the colony. Upon entering the seat of
imperial power, Waidwen’s body physically transformed into something otherworldly.
According to most records from the era, his flesh appeared to become luminescent and his
head completely transformed into pure (sometimes literally blinding) light.
Stories say that people asked Waidwen to lead the colony and that he accepted, becoming the first and only “Divine King” of Readceras. As king, his rule was virtually uncontested. He immediately punished allies of the empire and what he believed were corrupt churches and church leaders of Eothas. It was not long before worshipers of Eothas were punished for perceptions of heresy and nonworshipers were punished for following other faiths. When Readceran citizens fled to Dyrwood for sanctuary, it caused strife between the two nations that eventually led to the Saint’s War

During the conflict, Waidwen personally led many battles and exhibited extraordinary supernatural powers. Accounts describe him as being virtually untouchable and rumored that he was indestructible, possibly a full manifestation of Eothas’s power in the world. He was able to burn or even fully disintegrate enemies with beams of pure light.
It was not until the Battle of Halgot Citadel that he was significantly wounded. On that occasion, he was more than wounded: he was fully destroyed. The Dyrwoodans had constructed and placed a massive bomb inside the stonework of an ancient bridge (Evon Dewr Bridge) leading to the citadel gates. They also warned and swore to the Readcerans that Waidwen could never cross the bridge, trusting that his ultimate confidence would lead him directly over it. This was exactly what happened, and the resulting explosion apparently destroyed Waidwen, half a regiment of Readceran knights, and about a dozen Dyrwoodans who sacrificed themselves to stall the saint on the bridge.
The Dawnstars are another manifestation of Eothas, which most people agree have not been seen since they visited Waidwen. According to stories, the Dawnstars appear as the ethereal forms of a man and two women who represent three of the brightest stars in the sky, often the last three to remain visible before the sun rises.
They act as heralds of things to come, or as heralds of things Eothas wants to come, and as advisers to mortals at critical junctures.
Eothas has a final, more intimidating aspect in the form of Gaun—a farmer depicted as carrying a lantern and sickle. Gaun is a figure of dignified, cyclical death as opposed to Rymrgand’s entropic variety or Berath’s cold inevitability. In context, his presence surrounds the harvest, rebirth, spring, and the general celebration of mortality. His implements are symbolically important: the sickle reaps what is sowed in life, and the lantern guides the deceased down their intended paths of death and rebirth. It is generally believed that Gaun, instead of Berath’s avatars, visits those who embrace death with acceptance and understanding.
Gaun still fits with Eothas’s character as a bringer of light, but incorporates a sense of relentlessness that proves more disconcerting than hopeful. The weak and the underprivileged—while not necessarily under Gaun’s protection—are nevertheless under his scrutiny in case anyone should seek to do them harm. Gaun is an answerer of wrongs and imbalances, or whatever he interprets as imbalance. This has contributed in no small part to Dyrwood’s enthusiasm for vigilante justice. Popular regard for Gaun is polarizing: he is appreciated and feared, and exudes a grim sense of finality.
The Night Market is a secret society of extraordinarily devoted Eothasians who
operate in Dyrwood. In addition to ministering to the needs of ordinary Eothasians
who cannot worship publicly, the Night Market attempts to track and fight against
any dark forces that would threaten Dyrwood. Their hope is that they can mend the rela-
tionship between Dyrwoodans and Eothas by performing heroic, patriotic acts for the
benefit of all residents of Dyrwood. However, some members of the Night Market wish
to transform the purpose of the group into something quite different: an anti-Dyrwood
organization seeking revenge for the Battle of Halgot Citadel.
