From her heavenly Court of Birds, Hylea sees all that passes on the earth below, and she commands the allegiance—or at least the respect—of every living creature that takes to the air. She wraps herself in a mantle of many colors, made from
the feathers of every species of bird that has ever been seen. Hylean priests undertake expeditions into the wild to discover new species of birds and expand the power of their goddess. Her Court of Birds is a lively place, often depicted in art and song, full of sound and color and invention.
Hylea has never been known to appear in human form, but she is thought to be mani-
fest in birds of all kinds, who serve as her eyes and ears in the mortal world. The greater the
number of birds that are present in a particular place, the greater the likelihood that the Sky-Mother is watching.
She may also manifest in the cries of a woman in childbirth. When a mother dies to bring new life into the world, it is thought that her soul is carried directly to Hylea’s court and transformed into one of her avian attendants. Children whose mothers died at birth are believed to be sacred to the Queen of Birds, since (according to stories) their mothers have her ear and she watches over them throughout their lives. 
Hylea has both a formal and an informal clergy. Her official temples are aviaries, usually with many windows and skylights, sometimes with ceilings of glass, and filled with local birds of every kind. They often double as artists’ and writers’ salons, with the creative classes among her most fervent devotees. Her informal clergy are midwives, scattered across the countryside, who are trained in the medical arts and deliver children in their goddess’s name. They have no temples to speak of, but they will always wear a fetish or charm of colorful feathers—a sign that they have been trained by their predecessors and
blessed by the goddess. 
Before the destruction of Saint Waidwen at  Godhammer Citadel, Hylea was an ally and
friend of Eothas, since both gods had a hand in birth and new beginnings. Her priesthood
mourns his disappearance on the anniversary of Saint Waidwen’s “death” and commis-
sions plays and poems in his honor. They are also rumored to have accepted a number of
Eothasian clergy into their own ranks, in an effort to save them from the vengeful followers
of Magran. This has somewhat dampened the Queen of Birds’ faith in Dyrwood and raised tensions between her and Magran.
Artists and poets often keep birds in their homes, hoping that the goddess will whisper
to them in their sleep. Among the wild orlans, though, creative inspiration is seen not as a
gift but as something to be stolen from the goddess. Their poets and singers organize
hunts in the deep forest, seeking the rarest and most colorful birds, which are then slain
and eaten. To eat of the goddess’s flesh is the only way to capture her divine creative spark,
in their view. Accordingly, the Sky-Mother has no clergy among the wild orlans, and
childbirth is said to be particularly painful and difficult for their kind.
