A dethroned old noblewoman, often shown wandering the open road in tattered finery,
Woedica is usually depicted with burned and withered skin, having been cast from
her rightful seat by war and burned in Magran’s fire . . . though she always keeps
her dignity and plots her (rightful) revenge. Some stories suggest that she may once have
claimed rulership over some or all of the gods, but if this is true, then she was cast down in the far distant past. 
Priestesses of the Exiled Queen serve as lawyers and judges in towns and urban centers, and the most prominent among them are advisers to kings and lords. They are of particular importance in the Aedyran Empire, where by tradition, business contracts always require their endorsement. Her devotees are typically found in the upper classes, but any conservative person who longs for a vanished past will find a place in her faith. “When Woedica takes back her throne” is a common saying among her followers, signifying a utopian future when society will be properly ordered once again, and she will take her rightful place as ruler of the gods.
Woedican clergy typically rely on local
authorities to enforce the law. However, they maintain a loose association with a much-feared order of Woedican paladins, known as the Steel Garrote, who partner with powerful individuals and business interests to hunt down those who violate contracts (especially if they are endorsed by the Woedican Church). The Steel Garrote is active throughout the Aedyran Empire (where it was founded) and its former colonies, and the Vailian Republics.
The Exiled Queen’s memory is flawless—she remembers every transgression, every slight. People say a quick prayer to her when they want to remember something they’ve forgotten. 
Woedica’s only known manifestation is the Strangler, a leathery-skinned old woman,
always clad in tattered finery, who appears on an empty road or abandoned alleyway
to murder those who break a solemn oath. According to the few witnesses who claim to
have seen her, the Strangler is supernaturally agile and quick, and all the reports agree that
she wears a wild grin as she pursues her quarry. The Strangler’s wiry form hides a formidable strength—she can throttle a grown aumaua with her bare hands. In some cases, multiple Stranglers have been seen at once, if their target proves especially difficult. Woedica’s avatar is believed to have slain several famous usurpers in Dyrwoodan history, though it is possible that the real murderers merely blamed the goddess. Also for this reason, (serious) oath breaking is punished by strangulation in many cultures.
